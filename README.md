# 🧠💰 Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model Implementation 🎯📊

> A computational journey into the world of **options pricing**, exploring **terminal value** and **profit/loss dynamics** with respect to market model behavior 📈🧾

## 📜 A Quick History: What is the Black-Scholes Model? ⏳

The **Black-Scholes Model**, developed by **Fischer Black**, **Myron Scholes**, and **Robert Merton** in the early 1970s, revolutionized financial markets 🏦💡. It provides a theoretical framework for pricing **European call and put options** based on a set of assumptions including:

🔸 The stock follows a **geometric Brownian motion**  
🔸 No arbitrage opportunities 🧩  
🔸 Markets are frictionless (no transaction costs or taxes) ⚖️  
🔸 Continuous trading and risk-free rate is constant 📆💲  

In 1997, **Myron Scholes** and **Robert Merton** were awarded the **Nobel Prize in Economics** 🏅 (Fischer Black had passed away by then and was ineligible for the prize).
